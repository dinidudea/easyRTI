# easyRTI

This is a web application that allows users to generate Right to Information (RTI) requests in multiple languages (Sinhala, Tamil, and English). Users [in the complete final version] can select an institution [from a list], choose a template, and generate a PDF of their request. I don't know how to code, so I have used generative AI to put this together. I still need a tonne of help, so let me know if you can help with (UI is a first to make it look less fugly).

Any edits with GAI as comments are edits that I made through generative AI, so would definitely need having looked-at by humans because I don't know coding at all.

## Roadmap

- Multi-language support [Mostly done]
- UI needs disclaimers about data not being recorded. [Needs to be done]
- Non-fugly dark-mode UI [Needs to be done]
- Searchable institution list [Working on it]

-    Using Google Maps API [Idea]
-    User registration for collab support [Parked]
- Template selection for requests [Low priority]
- PDF generation [Parked]
- Email functionality [Parked]
- Generative AI assistance for request generation [Parked]
