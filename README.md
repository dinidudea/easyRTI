# easyRTI

This is a web application that allows users to generate Right to Information (RTI) requests in multiple languages (Sinhala, Tamil, and English). Users can select an institution, choose a template, and generate a PDF of their request. I don't know how to code, so I have used generative AI to put this together. I still need a tonne of help, so let me know if you can help with (UI is a first to make it look less fugly).
